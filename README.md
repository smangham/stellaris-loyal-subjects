[b]Version 3.14.*[/b]

Federation members and associated are perfectly OK with you cracking enemy planets. Your vassals, however, are not. This mod fixes that, by editing the world-cracking/assimilating/pacifying/etc. script to give your loyal subjects the same blase attitude towards your permanent and irreversible destruction of a planet as your federation members.

After all, [i][b]loyal[/b] subjects have nothing to fear[/i]...
